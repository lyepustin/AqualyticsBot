### Dependencies

Noteable dependencies include:

- [YOLOv8 ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- [Open CV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
- [SoundCard](https://pypi.org/project/SoundCard/)
- [PyAutoGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/)

Dependencies can be installed using [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) as follows:

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the project

Setup the game as follows:

- Use default UI scale
- Turn off all nameplates
- Options -> Enable Sound -> Effects on 100% (all other sub volumes on 0%)
- Ensure "Click to Move" is turned off.
- Ensure Auto Loot is switched on.

Setup program configuration:

- Keybind fish action to 9, or change `KEY_LOOKUP` in the [config](fishing/config.py).
- Set up screen size, or change `PIX_X` and `PIX_Y`, in the [config](fishing/config.py). Defaults to 2560 x 1080.
- Optionally configure speaker to listen to for fish sounds using `SPEAKER_ID` in [config](fishing/config.py). Uses system default speaker by default.
  Ensure game sound is coming from the same speaker. This allows the user to e.g. listen to music on a different speaker
  whilst fishing.

The package can then be installed as follows:

```commandline
python setup.py install
```

Run the fishing program via:

```commandline
python -c "import fishing; fishing.fish()"
```

It will run for a default of 30 minutes. Pass number of hours to the main function e.g. for 2 hours use
`fishing.fish(2)`. Then click on the game window to begin.

### Task List

- [ ] Audio signal inference to use only game sound, currently it listens to all desktop sounds.
- [ ] Work in background, so that user can run other applications actively.
- [ ] AFK and logout/login features.
- [ ] Automatic screen size detection.
